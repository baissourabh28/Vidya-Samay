# Requirements Document: College Timetable Scheduling System

## Introduction

The College Timetable Scheduling System is a web-based intelligent application designed to automate and optimize the creation of academic timetables for colleges. The system maximizes classroom and laboratory utilization, minimizes faculty and student workload conflicts, ensures learning outcomes are met, and adapts to real-time changes such as faculty leaves and room availability. The system supports multi-department operations, multiple shifts (UG/PG), and complies with NEP 2020 guidelines for flexible electives and multidisciplinary courses.
